# hotel_project
Introductory project to learn Python.

This project is an introduction to Python and object oriented programming. My goals are to gain an understanding of object oriented programming, learn how to effectively use my programming platform(VScode), and to create a basic hotel reservation service.

I aim to make a way to create, manage, and identify different guests, rooms, and reservations in my hotel. The hotel I am creating uses JSON to provide information about all of the rooms in it. I also intend to use an id based system for object identification in my various classes: Reservation, Guest, etc.
